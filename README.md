# Golyatsec Guard Bot (v3.8) (28.06.2022)

Information:

As a company serving in the cyber security industry, we are proud to present you our security bot that we have developed for Discord users.

Our bot, which we offer under the name Golyatsec Guard, has been prepared for your needs with the most up-to-date technology and software systems. It is also designed to focus on your server security.

Introduction:

Since our bot has the most up-to-date v13 infrastructure, we want it to get along well with Discord. At the same time, your cyber security and privacy are of primary importance to us. We do not use the "prefix" system in this context. We use the officially supported "slash" commands system.

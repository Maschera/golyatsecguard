## Description:

As a company serving in the cyber security industry, we are proud to present you our security bot that we have developed for Discord users.

Our project, which we offer under the name Golyatsec Guard, has been prepared for your needs with the most up-to-date infrastructure and software systems. Our project is based on server, user, and environment (chat) security. At the same time, our project, which has official Discord approval, meets all the necessary standards in the best way.

## Introducing:

First of all, we are a cyber security firm. In this context, while we were preparing our project, we did not take any action that would put the privacy and security of our valued users at risk. As a result, we use the officially supported "slash commands" system, meet the most up-to-date and recommended software requirements, work on servers that are encrypted in military standards and that we constantly monitor, and we do not store or save any of your data.

We protect all our systems to the highest standards and back them up constantly. We also keep our operations and projects under legal guarantee.
